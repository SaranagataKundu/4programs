List of 4 programs
<br>
1. Rainfall prediction of Kolkata  using NASA's power data access view (DAV) for 22 years (2000-2021). I have Decision Tree algorithm for rainfall prediction and feature selection technique Pearson Correlation.
2. Simple emoji prediction program using a machine learning approach. The program uses a sample dataset with text and corresponding emoji labels to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The scikit-learn library is employed for data processing, feature extraction, and model training.
3. Simple program for generating random passwords. It defines a function called generate_password that takes an optional parameter specifying the length of the desired password (default is 12 characters). The function utilizes the string module to define a set of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols.
4. A simple machine learning model to classify images of handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. This program uses the scikit-learn library, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
